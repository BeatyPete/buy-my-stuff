## Installation

Clone the repository from https://github.com/BeatyPete/buy-my-stuff

## Usage 

Open the command line in the directory of the application and use 'npm install'. You must also create a .env file to hold your username, password, and databse name which should be "ecommerce_db". Then use 'mysql -u root -p' followed by your password to initialize the database. For a set of test data use "npm run seed". 'npm start' will open the server, and you can now acces the api endpoints.
